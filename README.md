<h1>Meteor Minigames Addon</h1>
<p>Why play Minecraft when you can play other shit inside of Minecraft?</p>
</div>

**This is a standalone addon containing the minigames that come with my Meteor Client addon [Stardust](https://github.com/0xTas/stardust).**<br>
**If you are already using Stardust, then there is no need to download this addon.**

## Installation
- First, ensure that Fabric for Minecraft 1.21.4 is installed, along with Meteor Client 1.21.4.
- You can either download the [latest release](https://github.com/0xTas/meteor-minigames-addon/releases/latest), or clone and build the addon using `./gradlew build`.
- Drop the addon jar inside your mods folder alongside Meteor client. That's all!

## Minigames
- **Minesweeper**
    - Classic Minesweeper with custom difficulty settings and configurable color schemes.
- **Meteorites**
    - A custom-built Asteroids-like arcade shooter with powerups and boss waves.
    - Every 3 waves, gain a new random powerup if you don't already have one.
    - Every 6 waves, gain an additional life, up to 5.
    - Every 10 waves presents a challenging boss wave.
    - Supports saves and tracks high score data.
    - Find out which powerups and strategies can take you the farthest!
    - You can see a demo of the game in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu2lorSXFKg).
    - Tip: if you find the HUD text difficult to read, picking a different font may help. I like Cascadia Code.
- More to come..?
